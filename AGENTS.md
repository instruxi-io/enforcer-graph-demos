# AGENTS.md: working in enforcer-graph-demos

One page. Read it once, then work.

## What this repository is

Two viewers for a plan held in Enforcer Graph, extracted from the service's own
tree so they can be read, run and changed without the service:

- `graphwatch/`: a terminal viewer in Go. Standard library only, on purpose.
  `go run . --demo --layout mycelium` is an offline demo that needs no API and
  no key; `--graph <id>` watches a real graph; `--demo` alone creates and works
  one in your workspace.
- `graph-live/`: a browser viewer in React. Watch mode reads and listens and
  never writes. Demo mode creates a `demo-<scenario>-<time>` graph and drives
  it through the API as a set of harnesses would.

Both draw the same thing: nodes as dots coloured by the server's `work_state`,
edges flipped so work flows down and out, heat for activity.

## Run and verify

```bash
cd graphwatch && go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./...
cd graph-live && GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm run build
```

`npm run build` needs no API key. `npm run dev` refuses to start without
`GRAPH_API_KEY`, by design: the Vite dev server proxies `/api/v1/graph` to the
real API and adds the key there, so the key never reaches the bundle or the
browser. Do not move the key into client code.

The golden tests under `graphwatch/` compare the layered layout (four frames)
and the mycelium demo frames (mid-growth and settled, particles removed) against
text files in `graphwatch/testdata/`. Growth is seeded from node ids with no clock and no
randomness; if you change what is drawn, regenerate the goldens on purpose
(`go test ./... -run GoldenPinned -update`)
and say so in the commit.

## Rules that are not obvious

1. **A `requires` edge points FROM the dependent TO its prerequisite.** Both
   viewers flip it once, in one place (`graphwatch/layout.go`,
   `graph-live/src/live.ts`). Flip it anywhere else and arrows reverse silently.
2. **Draw the server's `work_state`; never re-derive it** from status and edges.
   The service computes it in one SQL function and the viewers would disagree
   with it in exactly the cases that matter (reclaims, verifying, held).
3. **Every event means refetch.** The stream is a clock, not a data source. Its
   frames are thin; the viewers invalidate and re-read `/nodes` and `/edges`.
4. **Watch mode writes nothing.** The demo driver is the only code that calls a
   write, and only Demo mode calls into it. Keep it that way, and keep
   `GRAPH_LIVE_LOG=1` useful: it prints method and path per proxied request so a
   reviewer can confirm Watch mode issues only GETs and the stream.
5. **Nothing is archived automatically.** A demo graph stays until a person
   archives it. Do not add cleanup that deletes graphs.
6. **No hand-written fetch in graph-live.** Reads and the driver's writes go
   through the generated `@instruxi-io/graph-hooks` functions. That is the point
   of the example. `graphwatch` is the opposite: a plain `net/http` client,
   because it must build with the standard library alone.
7. **Send only changed cells.** `graphwatch` diffs frames and quantises colours
   to 16 levels per channel so a cooling node stops repainting. A full repaint
   per frame was measured growing a terminal's memory by about 0.3 GB a minute.
8. **Never commit a key, a token or a transcript.** `.npmrc` reads `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   from the environment at install time and is committed without a value.
9. **Navigation commands are read-only.** Every `graphwatch` command other than
   `--demo` issues GET only; each lives in `graphwatch/cmd_<name>.go` and
   registers itself from `init()`.

## Credentials

- `GRAPH_API_KEY`: an Enforcer API key. Both viewers accept it.
- `GRAPH_AUTH_HELPER`: `graphwatch` only: a command that prints a JSON object
  of request headers. Pointing it at the `enforcer` Claude Code plugin's header
  helper lets the viewer ride the plugin's OAuth sign-in and refresh on a 401.
- `GRAPH_BASE_URL`: the API origin, default `https://api.instruxi.dev`.

A key or sign-in with only `enforcer:read` is enough to watch. Demo mode also
needs `enforcer:graph-graph-import.write` (graphwatch creates its demo graph
through `POST /graphs/import`) or the graph-nodes, graph-edges and graph-runs
write scopes (graph-live's driver claims, heartbeats and completes runs).

## Conventions

- Keep each viewer self-contained. `graphwatch` imports nothing outside the
  standard library; `graph-live` depends on React, TanStack Query, xyflow and
  the published hooks, nothing else.
- Comments say why, not what. The existing files are the register to match.
- A change to what is drawn gets a golden test or a screenshot in the PR.
- Scenarios live in `graph-live/src/scenarios/<name>.ts` with an id, title,
  one-line description, `build()` and `drive()`. Add one by adding a file and
  registering it in `index.ts`.

## Where the rest is

- The `enforcer` Claude Code plugin, install and sign-in:
  https://github.com/instruxi-io/claude-plugins
- The graph service and the hook packages are private to the organisation. The
  two conventions that matter here: a `requires` edge points from the dependent
  to its prerequisite, and a loop is a set of runs, never an edge.
